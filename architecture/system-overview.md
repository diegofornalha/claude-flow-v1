# E-Commerce Microservices Architecture Overview

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a scalable, secure, and modular microservices architecture for a modern e-commerce platform. The architecture follows cloud-native principles with emphasis on resilience, scalability, and maintainability.

## Architecture Principles

1. **Domain-Driven Design**: Services aligned with business domains
2. **API-First**: All services expose well-defined APIs
3. **Event-Driven**: Asynchronous communication for loose coupling
4. **Cloud-Native**: Container-based, orchestrated with Kubernetes
5. **Security by Design**: Zero-trust architecture with mTLS
6. **Observable**: Comprehensive monitoring and tracing

## Scalability Considerations

1. **Horizontal Scaling**: All services designed for horizontal scaling
2. **Auto-scaling**: Based on CPU, memory, and custom metrics
3. **Load Balancing**: Service mesh with Istio
4. **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching (CDN, API Gateway, Application, Database)
5. **Database Sharding**: For user and order data

## Security Architecture

1. **Zero Trust Network**: All communication encrypted with mTLS
2. **API Security**: OAuth2 with JWT tokens
3. **Secret Management**: HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager
4. **Compliance**: PCI DSS for payments, GDPR for data privacy

## Monitoring and Observability

1. **Metrics**: Prometheus + Grafana
2. **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
3. **Tracing**: Jaeger for distributed tracing
4. **Alerting**: PagerDuty integration

## Disaster Recovery

1. **Backup Strategy**: Automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery
2. **Multi-region**: Active-passive setup for disaster recovery
3. **RTO/RPO**: 1 hour RTO, 15 minutes RPO
4. **Chaos Engineering**: Regular failure testing
